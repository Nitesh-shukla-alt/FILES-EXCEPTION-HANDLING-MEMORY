    "\"\"\" Q1 – What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS Interpreted languages execute source code line by line via an \n",
    "interpreter at runtime, translating each statement into machine instructions on the fly. This makes development fast—no separate build\n",
    "step—but adds interpreter overhead and typically slower execution. Compiled languages translate the entire source into machine-code binaries \n",
    "ahead of time. The resulting executables run directly on the CPU with minimal translation overhead, so they tend to be faster and more efficient, \n",
    "but require an explicit compile step before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 – What is exception handling in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS Exception handling in Python is the mechanism that lets you catch and respond to runtime errors without\n",
    "crashing your program. You enclose potentially error-raising code in a try block, then provide one or more except blocks to handle specific exception\n",
    "types. Optionally, you can add an else block to run code when no exception occurs and a finally block to perform cleanup regardless of whether an \n",
    "exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 – What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling? \n",
    "ANS The finally block always executes after the corresponding try and any except\n",
    "or else blocks, whether or not an exception was raised. It’s ideal for cleanup tasks—closing files, releasing locks, or rolling back transactions—to\n",
    "ensure resources are freed even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 – What is logging in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "ANS Logging is the practice of recording events or diagnostic information from your application. Python’s built-in logging \n",
    "module lets you emit log messages at different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), configure outputs (console, files, remote \n",
    "                                                                                                                           servers), and format \n",
    "entries with timestamps, module names, and stack traces to help with debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5 – What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS  __del__ is a special “destructor” method called when an object is about \n",
    "to be garbage-collected (i.e., when its reference count drops to zero). You can override it to perform last-moment cleanup—closing sockets or \n",
    "deleting temporary files—but its execution timing is not guaranteed, so context managers (with statements) are preferred for critical cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6  – What is the difference between import and from … import in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS import module brings the entire module into your namespace; you then reference its members as module.name.\n",
    "\n",
    "from module import name1, name2 imports only the specified attributes or functions directly into your local namespace, letting you refer to \n",
    "them by unqualified names. The latter can reduce verbosity but risks name collisions.\n",

    "\"\"\" Q8  – What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS  The with statement invokes a context manager that automatically \n",
    "calls the file object’s __enter__() and __exit__() methods. In the case of file handling, it opens the file at block entry and guarantees that\n",
    "file.close() is called when the block exits—whether normally or via an exception—so you never forget to close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9– What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS Multithreading runs multiple threads in the same process space, sharing memory. It’s lightweight and good for I/O-bound tasks but suffers from \n",
    "the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, which prevents true parallel execution of Python bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing spawns separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. It avoids GIL limitations and achieves true \n",

    " ANS Provides a persistent, timestamped record of application activity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q11  – What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS Memory management in Python is the process by which the interpreter allocates and frees memory for\n",
    "objects. It uses an internal allocator with memory pools, automatic reference counting,and a generational garbage collector to reclaim unused objects and manage fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12– What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS try: Wrap code that may raise errors.\n",

    "(Optional) finally: Execute always for cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13  Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS Because efficient memory use ensures your application runs quickly, avoids running out of RAM, \n",

    "Q14 – What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS \n",
    "try: Identifies the block of code to monitor for exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "except: Specifies how to handle each type of exception raised inside the try block, preventing unhandled errors from crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15 – How does Python’s garbage collection system work? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS Python uses reference counting to track how many references point to an object; when it drops\n",
    " to zero, the object is immediately reclaimed. To break reference cycles, it also employs\n",
    "a generational garbage collector that periodically scans and collects cyclic garbage in\n",
    "three aging generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16  – What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling? \n",

    "It separates normal execution logic from error-handling code, making the structure \n",

    "Q18  – What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS  os.fork() is a Unix-only, low-level system call that duplicates the current process, inheriting memory and file descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiprocessing module provides a cross-platform, higher-level API that emulates forking on Windows via spawn() or forkserver(), handles\n",

    "\n",
    "Q19  – What is the importance of closing a file in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS Closing a file flushes any buffered output to disk, frees the underlying file descriptor \n",
    "    resource, and releases locks so other programs can access the file. Leaving files open can exhaust the OS’s file handle limit and risk\n",
    "    data loss if the program crashes.\n",

    "Q20  – What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",

    "Q23  – What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS  Common challenges include memory leaks from lingering references \n",
